### What I learned

To be able to apply a border property to a table row `tr`, a `border-collapse: collapse` property must be added to the table. Otherwise the border won't show up.

### Useful resources

I made extensive use of this [fluid typography calculator](https://fluidtypography.com/#usarusFluidTypographyGetStarted). But even more interestingly, I used it to calculate fluid paddings too! This way, my media query size jumps would not be as jarring.
